	<article class="copy"><p>We scrutinize each of our single serve cups for absolute perfection, making sure every cup is filled precisely with the specified amount of coffee, tea or cocoa. Finally, we hand check every completed cup. If it’s not perfect, it’s not going anywhere. But the real secret is in the cup itself: Decades of experience in product engineering led to the design of our patented unique tension-based caged filter system. Our single serve cups have been tested and proven to be better. In fact, an independent test found that our advanced filter system helps the grounds diffuse better throughout, and enhancing the flavor by 15%.</p>
